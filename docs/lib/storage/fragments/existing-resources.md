Import an existing S3 bucket by running:

```bash
amplify import storage
```

Refer to [the related CLI documentation](~/cli/storage/import.md) for more details.

Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](~/lib/project-setup/create-application.md#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
