Import existing Amazon Cognito Identity Pools and User Pools by running:

```bash
amplify import auth
```

Refer to [the related CLI documentation](~/cli/auth/import.md) for more details.


Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](~/lib/project-setup/create-application.md#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
